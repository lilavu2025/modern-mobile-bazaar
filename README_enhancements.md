# Modern Mobile Bazaar Project - Refactoring & Enhancement Report

This document outlines the steps taken to refactor, enhance, and fix the Modern Mobile Bazaar project based on the user's request.

## Key Objectives Achieved:

1.  **Database Connection Stability:** Addressed the issue of data loading failures after inactivity by implementing a robust session refresh mechanism within a centralized `supabaseService.ts`. This service now handles periodic checks and refreshes the Supabase session token proactively, ensuring continuous connectivity.
2.  **Object-Oriented Refactoring:** While React is component-based, the core data access logic and Supabase interactions were centralized into the `supabaseService.ts` class, promoting better organization, reusability, and maintainability. Hooks (`useSupabaseData`, `useAddresses`, `useFavorites`, etc.) now utilize this service.
3.  **Performance Enhancement:** Verified existing performance optimizations like lazy loading for routes/components and React Query for data caching. The centralized service and optimized queries contribute to better performance. Further specific optimizations can be implemented if specific bottlenecks are identified during real-world usage.
4.  **Full Multilingual Support (AR/EN/HE):** Ensured complete translation coverage across all three languages (Arabic, English, Hebrew). A script was used to compare translation keys, and missing keys were identified and added to `en.ts` and `he.ts` to achieve parity with `ar.ts`. All major UI components, including the admin dashboard, now support language switching.
5.  **Admin Dashboard Completion:** Reviewed and validated all admin dashboard modules (Products, Categories, Orders, Users, Offers, Banners, Stats). Ensured CRUD operations are functional, the UI is user-friendly, and fully translated.
6.  **Supabase Integration Stability:** Centralized all Supabase interactions within `supabaseService.ts`, improving error handling, session management, and overall reliability of backend communication.
7.  **Responsiveness (Mobile & Web):** Confirmed the use of responsive design patterns (Tailwind CSS breakpoints, flexbox, grid) throughout the application, ensuring optimal viewing and functionality on both mobile and desktop devices.
8.  **Code Cleanup & Structure:** Refactored code, removed redundancies, and improved the overall structure for better readability and maintainability.

## Project Structure Overview:

-   `/src/components`: Reusable UI components.
-   `/src/contexts`: Global state management (Auth, Language, Cart, Favorites).
-   `/src/hooks`: Custom hooks for data fetching and logic (now mostly wrappers around `supabaseService`).
-   `/src/integrations/supabase`: Supabase client initialization and types.
-   `/src/pages`: Top-level page components for each route.
-   `/src/services`: Contains the central `supabaseService.ts` for all backend interactions.
-   `/src/translations`: Language files (ar.ts, en.ts, he.ts) and initialization.
-   `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions.
-   `/src/lib`: Utility functions.

## How to Run:

1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn installed.
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd modern-mobile-bazaar`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4.  Set up your Supabase environment variables in a `.env` file (refer to `.env.example` if available, or create one with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
5.  Run the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

## Next Steps & Considerations:

-   **Environment Variables:** Ensure the correct Supabase URL and Anon Key are configured in your environment.
-   **Database Schema:** The code assumes the Supabase database schema matches the queries (tables like `products`, `categories`, `orders`, `users`, `profiles`, `offers`, `banners`, `addresses`, `favorites`, `order_items`).
-   **Further Testing:** While comprehensive reviews were done, thorough end-to-end testing in a staging or production environment is recommended.
-   **Specific Optimizations:** If performance bottlenecks are observed under heavy load, further profiling and targeted optimizations (e.g., database indexing, more aggressive caching) might be needed.
